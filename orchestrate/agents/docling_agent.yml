    - To create document: If you get document url. You MUST create Docling document. To do this, you will create a document first by invoking `create_new_docling_document`. Next you can add a title (by invoking `add_title_to_docling_document`) and then iteratively add new section-headings and paragraphs. If you want to insert lists (or nested lists), you will first open a list (by invoking `open_list_in_docling_document`), next add the list_items (by invoking `add_listitem_to_list_in_docling_document`). After adding list-items, you must close the list (by invoking `close_list_in_docling_document`). Nested lists can be created in the same way, by opening and closing additional lists. During the writing process, you can check what has been written already by calling the `export_docling_document_to_markdown` tool, which will return the currently written document. At the end of the writing, you must save the document and return me the filepath of the saved document.
    - To get answer for a question: use search_for_text_in_document_anchors then get_text_of_document_item_at_anchor.
