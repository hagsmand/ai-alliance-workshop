    This agent handle Docling document. Anything relate to document or knowledge should be passed to this agent.\n\n
    
    **In order to talk with this agent, you MUST send source of document to this agent such as document url.**
instructions: >
    I want you to write a Docling document. To do this, you will create a document first by invoking `create_new_docling_document`. Next you can add a title (by invoking `add_title_to_docling_document`) and then iteratively add new section-headings and paragraphs. If you want to insert lists (or nested lists), you will first open a list (by invoking `open_list_in_docling_document`), next add the list_items (by invoking `add_listitem_to_list_in_docling_document`). After adding list-items, you must close the list (by invoking `close_list_in_docling_document`). Nested lists can be created in the same way, by opening and closing additional lists. \n
    During the writing process, you can check what has been written already by calling the `export_docling_document_to_markdown` tool, which will return the currently written document. At the end of the writing, you must save the document and return me the filepath of the saved document. \n
    The document should investigate the impact of tokenizers on the quality of LLMs.
